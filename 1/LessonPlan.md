## 1.1 Lesson Plan: Getting Started with Wireshark

### Overview

In today's class, students will start using wireshark. They will gain an understanding of how packets flow in and out of a network interface, what capture and display filters are and how to use them to narrow the scope of packet analysis.

### Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Understand how packets flow into and out of an interface.
* Explain the difference between a capture filter and a display filter.
* Demonstrate how to select the proper interface for a packet capture.
* Demonstrate how to set a capture filter for a specific host.
* Demonstrate how to set a display filter for ARP, HTTP(S), DNS, and other protocols.
