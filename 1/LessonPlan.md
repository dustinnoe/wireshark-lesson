## 1.1 Lesson Plan: Getting Started with Wireshark

### Overview

In today's class, students will start using wireshark. They will gain an understanding of how packets flow in and out of a network interface, what capture and display filters are and how to use them to narrow the scope of packet analysis.

### Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Understand how packets flow into and out of an interface.
* Explain the difference between a capture filter and a display filter.
* Demonstrate how to select the proper interface for a packet capture.
* Demonstrate how to set a capture filter for a specific host.
* Demonstrate how to set a display filter for ARP, HTTP(S), DNS, and other protocols.

### Instructor Notes

* In today's class there will be some moment's where student's will get lost in the overwhelming number of packets they will be sorting through with WireShark.  Encourage them by telling them that it's all about finding the right filter to drill down into the data they are looking for.  If the material seems to easy for some students, remind that they are only getting started with WireShark and there are much more advanced features. The skills learned today are foundational to success in packet analysis.

* Welcome the students to their first real dive into network packet analysis and explain that packet analysis is key to many cybersecurity functions to include malware analysis, threat hunting, and network defense. 



* Let the class know that, by the end of the week the will be able to confidently capture and analyze traffic on the network they are responisble for.
